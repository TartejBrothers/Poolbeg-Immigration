        <h2>What is Stamp 1G?</h2>
        <p>
          Stamp 1G permits international students who have earned a Level 8 or 9
          qualification from a recognized Irish institution to remain in Ireland
          after their studies. This permission allows them to work full-time but
          does not authorize self-employment or business operations. To continue
          working beyond the validity of Stamp 1G, an employment permit is
          needed.

        <p>
          International students with Stamp 2 must apply for Stamp 1G through
          the Irish Immigration website. An account must be created, and a â‚¬300
          registration fee paid. Required documents include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A valid passport.</li>
          <li>An IRP card showing Stamp 2.</li>
          <li>A Statement of Final Results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If approved, a new IRP card will be sent by post, and applicants are
          not required to visit the Burgh Quay office. Processing typically
          takes 3-5 weeks.
