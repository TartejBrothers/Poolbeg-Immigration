      <h3>Employment Visa in Ireland</h3>
      <p>
        This permit is deemed to be the most sought-after employment permit to
        obtain in Ireland. It is designed to attract highly skilled people into
        the Irish labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up
        permanent residence in the State.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eligible occupations under this type of permit are deemed to be
        critically important to growing Ireland’s economy, are highly demanded
        and highly skilled, and are in a significant shortage of supply in our
        labour market. The list of eligible occupations is set out in the
        Critical Skills Occupations List. ​<br />
        Jobs which are eligible under the{" "}
        <u>Critical Skills Employment Permit</u> Ireland scheme do not need to
        undergo the <u>Labour Market Needs Test.</u>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Green Card type employment permit has been replaced by the Critical
        Skills Employment Permit. This permit is deemed to be the most
        sought-after employment permit to obtain in Ireland.

          Critical Skills Employment Permit holders can take up permanent
