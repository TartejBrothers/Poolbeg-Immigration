      <h2>What is the Labour Market Needs Test?</h2>
      <p>
        The Labour Market Needs Test is a requirement that employers must
        fulfill to prove that no suitable candidates from Ireland or the EEA are
        available for the job position before hiring a non-EEA national. Hereâ€™s
        how it works:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising the Vacancy:</strong>{" "}
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP):
              </strong>{" "}
              Advertise the position with DEASP Employment Services/EURES
              employment network for at least 28 days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>National Newspaper:</strong> Advertise the position in a
              national newspaper for a minimum of three days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Local Newspaper or Job Website:</strong> Advertise the
              position in either a local newspaper or a jobs website (excluding
              DEASP/EURES websites) for at least three days.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensuring that these steps are followed is crucial, as failing to meet
          these requirements is a common reason for the refusal of General
          Employment Permit applications.
        </li>
      </ol>

          <p>
            The Labour Market Needs Test ensures that job opportunities in
            Ireland are first offered to suitably skilled Irish and EEA
            (European Economic Area) nationals before being made available to
            non-EEA nationals. This test is designed to ensure that local talent
            is considered first and to prevent job vacancies from being filled
            by non-EEA nationals when suitable candidates from within the EEA
            are available.
